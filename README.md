## building :hammer:

**Platforms**

Please keep in mind that right now the project is in the **very pre-alpha** state.

### prerequisites

**C++20 Compiler**

The latest version of `clang` or `gcc` is recommended. On MacOS, you only need Xcode Command Line Tools. On Linux, use at least `gcc 11.2` or `clang 12`. If it is not installed, for Ubuntu you can use `apt install build-essential` and check the version with `gcc --version`. On Windows, you can use `mingw64`, which is equivalent to `gcc`, or a tool like Visual Studio.

Check the [ci system](https://github.com/josekoalas/melocoton/actions) to see an example of a complete implementation. I have tested it to work with:

| os                  | compiler           |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| ubuntu 20.04+       | clang 12           |
| ubuntu 22.04+       | gcc 11.2           |
| macos 11+           | apple clang 13     |
| macos 11+           | xcode 13           |
| windows server 2022 | visual studio 2022 |

Lower versions may work, but they are untested and unsupported (specially `gcc 11.1` and previous versions, since there is an internal compiler error that prevents the program form compiling).

**CMake**

`Cmake` is our build system of choice. You can download it from the [official website](https://cmake.org/download/), which is probably the easiest way. If you are on MacOS and have homebrew installed, you can simply do `brew install cmake`. In a recent Ubuntu distro you can use `apt install cmake` or `snap install cmake`.

**SDL2**

SDL2 handles cross platform window and input management. It needs to be installed for all non web builds. You can do so by:
- MacOS: Install using `brew install sdl2`.
- Debian/Ubuntu: Install using `apt install libsdl2-dev`.
- Windows: You may download the [development libraries](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) or use [`vcpkg`](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html) to manage the installation. If you choose the latter, run `vcpkg install sdl2`.
- Check the [official documentation](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation) for more information.

**Vulkan**

If you are going to build for Vulkan, you need to install the Vulkan SDK Development Kit, which contains the relevant Vulkan libraries. You can refer to the [official webpage](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) to download an installer for your operating system (choose "Latest SDK").
- MacOS/Windows: The installation should be one click.
- Debian/Ubuntu: You can download a .tar file, which you can decompress in a folder such as `~/vulkan`. Then, add the line `source ~/vulkan/1.x.yy.z/setup-env.sh` to `.profile` or the equivalent shell file, replacing the letters with the corresponding folder version name. There is also a repository for the latest versions of Ubuntu.
- For other OS or clarification follow the [official docs](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/linux/getting_started.html).

**OpenGL**

On MacOS you don't need to do anything to build for OpenGL. For Linux, install `apt install libglew-dev`. On Windows download if from the [official site](http://glew.sourceforge.net) or run `vcpkg install glew`.

**Web**

Building for web requires [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html), check their site for instructions.

**Other dependencies**

Some dependencies already come with this sample repository as submodules (imGUI, SPIR-V Cross, glm, stb and VulkanMemoryAllocator). You can find them in the [deps](https://github.com/josekoalas/melocoton/tree/main/deps) folder.

### build

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/josekoalas/melocoton
```

2. Go to the folder

```
cd melocoton
```

3. Build using CMake (replace TARGET as indicated below)

```
cmake -S . -B build {FLAGS}
cmake --build build --target {TARGET}
```

**Targets**

Right now it contains three targets:
-  OpenGL (`cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build --target fresa-opengl`)
-  Vulkan (`cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build --target fresa-vulkan`)
-  Web (`emcmake cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build --target fresa-web`)

You can rename the targets or add new ones in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

**Flags**

You might only be interested in creating only a Vulkan or an OpenGL build. Since `cmake` has to find all the necessary libraries in the configuration step (first command), there are two flags that can be added to remove the OpenGl/Vulkan targets alltogether.
- Don't use OpenGL `cmake -S . -B build -DNO_OPENGL=1`
- Don't use Vulkan `cmake -S . -B build -DNO_VULKAN=1`
If you want to use one of them again, you will either have to run that command for the first time with the flag `-DNO_OPENGL=0`/`-DNO_VULKAN=0`, or remove the `build` directory. When building for web these don't apply, since the targets are already removed.

**Output**

After the build, the `bin` folder will contain a binary named after the target you chose and a copy of the `res` folder. You can execute the binary for the application to run. Packaging it into an app container is still being worked on.

**Considerations**

This is very very **experimental** software, and building is in the alpha state, so there are some temporary fixes for some issues.
- When using OpenGL on Linux, the mesa drivers might have some issues loading the correct GL and GLSL versions, so you can override them by doing `export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.1` and `export MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=410`. Of course, your system needs to [support this version](https://gpuinfo.org), but most graphic cards should. A compatibility layer might be added for older versions in the future.
- Windows still needs work, it is not ready to be used.
